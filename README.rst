disclaimer
----------

This is a fork of the original django-generic-m2m package hosted at https://github.com/coleifer/django-generic-m2m that seems to be abandoned. By now the only changes are the addition of some on_delete statements in models.py to allow usage with django >= 2.0 and the replacement of the since django 1.11 deprecated _meta.virtual_fields with _meta.private_fields it aliased to.

relate anything to anything.  the image below is a screenshot of the `example app <https://django-generic-m2m.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html>`_ 
and shows a blog post that has been "related" to 2 "Place" models and a "City" model:

check the `documentation <https://django-generic-m2m.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for
more examples and an in-depth description of the app (or keep reading for
the 30 second version).


what it does
------------

the purpose of this project is to allow you to create database-level
relationships between various objects using a consistent api.


example app
-----------

bundled with the source code is an example app which shows how generic-m2m
can be used to create "tags" between models.  it uses `nathanborror's basic apps <https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps>`_
with `django-completion <https://github.com/coleifer/django-completion>`_ (shameless plug)
to allow users to "autocomplete" various relationships between models, so if I'm
a user and want to create a new blog post I can tag it with
relationships to objects representing a city, a place, a funny photo of a cat, etc.

quick overview
--------------

say you have a couple models::

    class Food(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

        related = RelatedObjectsDescriptor()

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.name


    class Beverage(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

        related = RelatedObjectsDescriptor()

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.name

Here's a sample interactive interpreter session to show the basic API::

    >>> pizza = Food.objects.create(name='pizza')
    >>> pepperoni = Food.objects.create(name='pepperoni')
    >>> beer = Beverage.objects.create(name='beer')
    >>> soda = Beverage.objects.create(name='soda')

    >>> pizza.related.connect(pepperoni)
    <RelatedObject: pizza related to pepperoni ("")>

    >>> pizza.related.connect(beer)
    <RelatedObject: pizza related to beer ("")>

    >>> pepperoni.related.related_to()  
    [<RelatedObject: pizza related to pepperoni ("")>]

    >>> pizza.related.all()
    [<RelatedObject: pizza related to beer ("")>, <RelatedObject: pizza related to pepperoni ("")>]

    >>> pizza.related.all().generic_objects()
    [<Beverage: beer>, <Food: pepperoni>]

    >>> Food.related.all()
    [<RelatedObject: pizza related to beer ("")>, <RelatedObject: pizza related to pepperoni ("")>]
